Go TLS
------

go-tls is an automated TLS certificate issuance and management tool. It can
generate keys, CSRs, and optionally obtain the certificate with an internal
Active Directory Certificate Services endpoint or the Let's Encrypt service.

An optional monitoring daemon is included to report and act on expiring
certificates.
